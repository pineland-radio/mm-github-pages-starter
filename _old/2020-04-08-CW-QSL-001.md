`First CW QSL`

It had been since the late 1980's or early 1990's since the PRC had made an actual CW contact.  That would probably have been on  a PRC 70  - while serving in the military.

Hence, the road back to passable Morse Code has been a long one (and no claim on mastery is made here). The hardest part has been reading punctuations and numbers (in that order).  Previous military experience was strictly with 5 character (letter) groups.  Numbers came at predictable portions of the message traffic.

The [Straight Key Century Club][1] was joined (#22027) and a study made of the materials on their website.  The proactive nature of the chat on the [SKCC Sked Page][2] was simple and compelling and after several false starts and a lengthy but fading QSO with K1GDH a QSL was made with NN3E.

This was challenging and a lot of work needs to be done to establish conversational CW comms.  Pretty exciting stuff though, and an achievement for the PRC.
