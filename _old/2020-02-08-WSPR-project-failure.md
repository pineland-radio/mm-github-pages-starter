`WSPR Project Failure`
---

The Pineland Radio Club's Test Lab and Production Facility (PRC-TL-PF) experienced its first setback today when the [QRPGuys EZ WSPR Pi Raspberry Pi module][1] build failed to achieve any results.

As the first DIY project the PRC had undertaken, expectations were high and mighty were the preparations.  Experiencing reception reports from [WSPR.Net][2] as the first HF transmission for the Club were highly anticipated.  

The failure was compounded by the total destruction of the PRC's first [Raspberry Pi3 Model B][3] and 32gb SD card.  The unit was destroyed during the trouble-shooting process when voltmeter probes [cross-connected the 5.5v pin and the 3.3 volt pin][4].  The RaspberrPi was trashed but it is believed the board components on the QRPGUys kit might be of value someday and the unit was placed in the salvage/reclamation area of the PRC-TL-PF.
