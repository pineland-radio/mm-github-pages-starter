`JS8 Call Logged`
---

Slowly learning and adapting to the native language of HAM radio.  The recent excitement of Digital Modes led to experimenting with the [JS8 Call protocol][1].  

**JS8 Call QSO - QSL** Success in radio comms is measured in verifed messages.  This can be done by an exchange of message logs shared over the internet.  The raw log of the first exchange is shown below.  This raw log can be uploaded on the internet to various logging sites. 
{: .notice--success}

Raw JS8 log of exchange with EA8TL in the [Canary Islands][2].

<div class="notice">
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The first three attempts ("EA8TL HW CPY?") to reach EA8TL were at 5 watts, 25 watts and then 50 watts; which was finally enough for his station to decode using the JS8 Call software.</p>
</div>

Following the exchange EA8TL's callsign was looked up on [QRZ.com][3].  This operator has set up his QRZ page to include the last serveral contacts logged.  This graphic shows a his log of KC3OEB.
