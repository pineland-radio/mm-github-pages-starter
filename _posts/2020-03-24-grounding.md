`RFI and Grounding`
---

Collocated with the radios - on the same bench - at the Pineland Radio Club's Test Lab and Production Facility (PRC-TL-PF) are two (2) computer workstations.  When transmitting at over 20 watts the left (or main workstation) suffered the loss of many of its connected USB devices.  The Keyboard, mouse, and USB connected drives would all drop out, disconnect and then reconnect after the transmission.

The (1) addition of Ferrite Cores on computer wiring was needed and also confirmed by fellow hams in the [NEMARC][1] and (2) the need for a good grounding for the radios was recommended. [Several sizes were procured][2] and added to the cabling associated with computer workstations.

**INFO NOTICE** Ferrite Cores are a way to provide protection from electro-magnetic interference (EMI) and radio-frequency interference (RFI).

Adding suitable grounding for the radios on the workbench was more labor intensive.  These photos below show the solution as of this date.

**DEFICIENCY** At the time of this posting transmission of 70 watts and greater cause the same problems.  Further troublshooting is required.
