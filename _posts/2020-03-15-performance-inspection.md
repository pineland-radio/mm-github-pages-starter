Time to take stock of the PRC's gear and performance so far.

Poor performance was shown in the 10 meter band with the Yaseau FT-891.  Voice comms on SSB weren't audible to fellow operators on the Saturday NEMARC net.  Some stations in the net are less than 5 miles away.
{: .notice--warning}

The clubs first participation in a contest was also poor.  Logging only 3 QSO's and only one of these being give a DXCC (whaterver that is).
{: .notice--warning}

![SSB Contest](/assets/images/gallery-005/contest-001.JPG){:height="75%" width="75%"}

With the addition of digital modes transmit capability, transmissions with QSO's were made in WSPR, FT8 and JS8-Call.

![Digital Modes](/assets/images/gallery-005/digital_modes-001.JPG){:height="75%" width="75%"}

WSPR power was set to 5 watts - lowest possible on the FT-981 - the results were surprising.

Gear was layed out for inventory:

The new piece of gear enabling digital modes was the Raspberry Pi.  It is used to control the Yaseau FT-891 and encode/decode the digital signals.  [OH8STN][1] and [KM4ACK's][2] websites and YouTube channels are to thank for the guidance and setting up the Raspbery Pi.  A work in progress the Pi is in a near constant state of rebuilding.  The latest addtion was the Real Time Clock (RTC) and a buck converter is being shipped to the PRC-TL-PF / QTH.
