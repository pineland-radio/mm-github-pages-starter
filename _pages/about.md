The Pineland Radio Club (PRC) is a notional organization.  It is not even a club, existing as nothing more that a place holder for the site owner to blog about radio experiences.  Radio experiences and interests likely including a dog and rucking about.  Hoping to combine [QRP][2] radio and going about on a mule or on a boat.

KC3OEB (the site owner) received the US [Technicians license][1] in OCT 2019 and [General License][1] in DEC 2019.  Prior to this study, was trained by the US Army in the 1980's to operate HF radio's and some Morse Code.
